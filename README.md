#### You can always count on me when I have the knowledgde and capability to help you out

I have a background in **digital design**, meaning I know some basics rules when designing a website.
(For example What's a good font height, is there enough contrast, spacing, ...) 
Also I have some experience using Creative cloud apps like Photoshop, Adobe XD, Premiere, Illustrator, ...
I would love to help here.

##### A funny story
When I was traveling in SE Asia me and 2 friends bought some old motorcycles to ride in Cambodja.
It was rainy season and my friend was not used to riding. So when we had to cross a railway which was on a small hill he got stuck in the mud. His first reflex was to give full throttle and ofcourse that worked but he really flew over the railway and almost hit a cow. 

Friend and Cow were okay!

###### TL;DR
> Friend did a amazing stunt on a motorcycle.
